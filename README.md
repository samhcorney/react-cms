# React CMS

## Roadmap
* Complete rewrite of backend ( all code is currently for testing )
* Add document store db ( couchdb / mongodb )
* Allow for east creation of custom type ( no modification to core )
* Finish checkbox type ( fix boolean types being saved as strings... currently being set as a string when passing the req to the backend + possibly also when setting the value in the cms )
* Test a template with a checkbox to show/hide the body. Use handlebars conditional if
* Fix overscroll on width of site
* Add type to state/params
